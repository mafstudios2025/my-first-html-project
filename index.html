  <h2> What makes fantasy a great genre in literature</h2>
</header>
<p>Fantasy is a captivating and enduring genre for a multitude of reasons, offering readers a unique blend of escapism, profound thematic exploration, and boundless imaginative possibilities. Here's a breakdown of what makes it so great</p>
<h2>Why i choose fantasy as my genre</h2>
<p> Fantasy is the genre that i like because when writing fantasy imagination is the key to expand creating your own universe from creating mythology inspired by many cultures that we know , from using magic and even using real life or real place as inspiration for  its creation,
sometimes fantasy could be the key  for telling stories as metaphors for the readers to know what the writer wants to say</P>
