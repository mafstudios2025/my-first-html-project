        <h2>what is literature</h2>
        <p>Literature, in its broadest sense, refers to any body of written works. However, when we speak of "literature" in an academic or artistic context, we are typically referring to imaginative works of poetry, prose (novels, short stories, essays), and drama that are distinguished by their aesthetic excellence, conscious arrangement of words, and profound exploration of the human experience</p>
